the way to following God. the process the faith increacing little to little. The whole life of Abraham. Abraham not so firm in the first beginning. He experience the hardship. he facing the difficult flee to Eygitpg. They were old couple, but his wife is beautiful. he afraid of being plunder and also he will be killed. Not be my wife but be my sister. 

Not pretect the wife. his wife bring to the palace. the old whose wife is plunder by others. in this there is God present.

Abraham and Sarah has a calling from God. Abraham is in great embrassing. the Egypt

> 【创13:9】[和合本]遍地不都在你眼前吗？请你离开我。你向左，我就向右；你向右，我就向左。”
> [ESV]Is not the whole land before you? Separate yourself from me. If you take the left hand, then I will go to the right, or if you take the right hand, then I will go to the left."

Lot no longer in the bless of God.

> 【创13:10】[和合本]罗得举目看见约旦河的全平原，直到琐珥，都是滋润的，那地在耶和华未灭所多玛、蛾摩拉以先，如同耶和华的园子，也像埃及地。
> [ESV]And Lot lifted up his eyes and saw that the Jordan Valley was well watered everywhere like the garden of the LORD, like the land of Egypt, in the direction of Zoar. (This was before the LORD destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah.)

The land is furitlize and very rich. 

> 【创13:12】[和合本]亚伯兰住在迦南地，罗得住在平原的城邑，渐渐挪移帐棚，直到所多玛。
> [ESV]Abram settled in the land of Canaan, while Lot settled among the cities of the valley and moved his tent as far as Sodom.

Sodom.

But Abraham choose the Cannan which is the land God promise to Abraham.

promise :

> 【创13:15】[和合本]凡你所看见的一切地，我都要赐给你和你的后裔，直到永远。
> [ESV]for all the land that you see I will give to you and to your offspring forever.
> 【创13:16】[和合本]我也要使你的后裔如同地上的尘沙那样多，人若能数算地上的尘沙，才能数算你的后裔。
> [ESV]I will make your offspring as the dust of the earth, so that if one can count the dust of the earth, your offspring also can be counted.

sojoner in the place. many wars occur

- 14 War between army

> 【创14:3】[和合本]这五王都在西订谷会合，西订谷就是盐海。
> [ESV]And all these joined forces in the Valley of Siddim (that is, the Salt Sea).

Abraham bring trained men. 318 and defeat the emermy.

> 【创14:14】[和合本]亚伯兰听见他侄儿（原文作“弟兄”）被掳去，就率领他家里生养的精练壮丁三百一十八人，直追到但。
> [ESV]When Abram heard that his kinsman had been taken captive, he led forth his trained men, born in his house, 318 of them, and went in pursuit as far as Dan.

- Melchizedek king of Salem

> 【创14:20】[和合本]至高的　神把敌人交在你手里，是应当称颂的。”亚伯兰就把所得的拿出十分之一来，给麦基洗德。
> [ESV]and blessed be God Most High, who has delivered your enemies into your hand!" And Abram gave him a tenth of everything.

- refuse the providence from the human king. reject be renined with any kingdom in the world. Treat GOD as his GOD.

> 【创14:21】[和合本]所多玛王对亚伯兰说：“你把人口给我，财物你自己拿去吧！”
> [ESV]And the king of Sodom said to Abram, "Give me the persons, but take the goods for yourself."

- 15 journey of Faith.

## Fear not

> 【创15:1】[和合本]这事以后，耶和华在异象中有话对亚伯兰说：“亚伯兰，你不要惧怕！我是你的盾牌，必大大地赏赐你。”
> [ESV]After these things the word of the LORD came to Abram in a vision: "Fear not, Abram, I am your shield; your reward shall be very great."

Fear not: the situation is very dangerous. As a soujorner is very weak. but involve in war. he will have a lot of enermy. Abraham doesn't unite with any courntry. The enermy will pay him back.

"Fear not" in bible: there is someone is more horrible than the 4 kings or 5kings. that is Jorhavad God. when God show himself to man. that is endtime to man. when God show himself with wrath. that is judgement. he will bring the iniquity and perish. When god show himself to man, that's bring the condemnment to a man. he perish the toward his people, his people fear of God. Mose lay on the Ground. And Isiash say to God: woe to me, I am lost. Even God's people encounter with fear. how God show himself to people? As everserry that is perishment. As a friend, that is fear not.

## REWARD but no Son

> 【创15:2】[和合本]亚伯兰说：“主耶和华啊，我既无子，你还赐我什么呢？并且要承受我家业的是大马士革人以利以谢。”
> [ESV]But Abram said, "O Lord GOD, what will you give me, for I continue childless, and the heir of my house is Eliezer of Damascus?"

(1) Son means to a man:

but Abram has no son. The son is a extention of a person in a lot of nation. with may son will has more power. 

After Adam sin against God he want to has a son. when he has the first the son "Cain". As a murder he try to protect himself with a city. he name the city as his son's name Enoch.

(2) God give the reward to Abram but no meaning.

is Eliezer of Damascus? Eliezer the servant of Abram will heir the wealth. That is a tragedy.

## limitation

> 【创15:3】[和合本]亚伯兰又说：“你没有给我儿子，那生在我家中的人就是我的后嗣。”
> [ESV]And Abram said, "Behold, you have given me no offspring, and a member of my household will be my heir."

no matter how man work, there is a limitation. 

 but God say to him, 

> 【创15:4】[和合本]耶和华又有话对他说：“这人必不成为你的后嗣，你本身所生的才成为你的后嗣。”
> [ESV]And behold, the word of the LORD came to him: "This man shall not be your heir; your very own son shall be your heir."

He promise him and give him an evidence.

## blueprint

> 【创15:5】[和合本]于是领他走到外边，说：“你向天观看，数算众星，能数得过来吗？”又对他说：“你的后裔将要如此。”
> [ESV]And he brought him outside and said, "Look toward heaven, and number the stars, if you are able to number them." Then he said to him, "So shall your offspring be."

God brough him outside and give him the blueprint. Abram look the sky at Cannan. The sky is clear.

The galaxy streth from east to west. God say to him.  "So shall your offspring be."

## righteousness

> 【创15:6】[和合本]亚伯兰信耶和华，耶和华就以此为他的义。
> [ESV]And he believed the LORD, and he counted it to him as righteousness.

Abraham has nothing but believe the Lord. He has the limitation of having a son. but he believe the Lord and will fullfil what he said. 

- righteousness: treat thing as it is. Treat God as God.

Abram God will fullfil for him. God treat faith as righteousness.

## Promise

> 【创15:7】[和合本]耶和华又对他说：“我是耶和华，曾领你出了迦勒底的吾珥，为要将这地赐你为业。”
> [ESV]And he said to him, "I am the LORD who brought you out from Ur of the Chaldeans to give you this land to possess."

Abram is a sojouner. If you want to give me the land, so what is the evidence?

The cavernent

> 【创15:9】[和合本]他说：“你为我取一只三年的母牛，一只三年的母山羊，一只三年的公绵羊，一只斑鸠，一只雏鸽。”
> [ESV]He said to him, "Bring me a heifer three years old, a female goat three years old, a ram three years old, a turtledove, and a young pigeon."

> 【创15:10】[和合本]亚伯兰就取了这些来，每样劈开分成两半，一半对着一半地摆列，只有鸟没有劈开。
> [ESV]And he brought him all these, cut them in half, and laid each half over against the other. But he did not cut the birds in half.

Very Act establish the cavernent will bring animal like this. cut the animal like this. in the middle part will full with blood.

The two sides of walk through the blood be in the covarnant. It should be a very strong relationship. Somebody betreat the cavenant will be cut into two like the animal. the red capet means the cavernant of life and death.

## expectation

> 【创15:11】[和合本]有鸷鸟下来落在那死畜的肉上，亚伯兰就把它吓飞了。
> [ESV]And when birds of prey came down on the carcasses, Abram drove them away.

Abram stand with patient. he is waiting the cavernant. brought the animal and cut the animal. He anticipate the God walk with him.

but he fell in deep sleep.

## The cavant

> 【创15:12】[和合本]日头正落的时候，亚伯兰沉沉地睡了，忽然有惊人的大黑暗落在他身上。
> [ESV]As the sun was going down, a deep sleep fell on Abram. And behold, dreadful and great darkness fell upon him.

he anticipating can go with the Lord. very exciting things can go with the God. The Almighty one can be with him. The blessing thing can be protected by God.

The union can be with the greatest king.

> 【创15:13】[和合本]耶和华对亚伯兰说：“你要的确知道，你的后裔必寄居别人的地，又服侍那地的人，那地的人要苦待他们四百年。
> [ESV]Then the LORD said to Abram, "Know for certain that your offspring will be sojourners in a land that is not theirs and will be servants there, and they will be afflicted for four hundred years.
>
> 【创15:14】[和合本]并且他们所要服侍的那国，我要惩罚，后来他们必带着许多财物从那里出来。
> [ESV]But I will bring judgment on the nation that they serve, and afterward they shall come out with great possessions.
> 【创15:15】[和合本]但你要享大寿数，平平安安地归到你列祖那里，被人埋葬。
> [ESV]As for yourself, you shall go to your fathers in peace; you shall be buried in a good old age.
> 【创15:16】[和合本]到了第四代，他们必回到此地，因为亚摩利人的罪孽还没有满盈。”
> [ESV]And they shall come back here in the fourth generation, for the iniquity of the Amorites is not yet complete."

the promise that gave the sleepy Abram.

the cavenant be bless still keep firm. but Abram not go with God. but 

> 【创15:17】[和合本]日落天黑，不料有冒烟的炉，并烧着的火把，从那些肉块中经过。
> [ESV]When the sun had gone down and it was dark, behold, a smoking fire pot and a flaming torch passed between these pieces.

Estoning us is God himself walk through it. God himself estalibish by himself the cavernant still vaild. 

Two sides all walk to through it. one of the cavernant (1)volate the cavernant will be punish.(2) break the cavernant.

(1) the one who break the cavernant will die. Abram break the cavernant God will die. God establish the cavernant by one sides. the God doesn't involve the Abraham. (2) the promise will be confirm by God.

misunderstanding: we were 50% in the cavernant. let all establish the God. Something we put God in a higher position. I want to have a my position. BUT God show this act the God himself walk through the piece. he according the faithfullness estabilsh the cavernant with man.  [The man will not be loyalty in the cavernant. God promise him those who born will be his offspring. he very own son is coming out from his wife Sarah. That the man is not dependable. ]

## How do I know you will give the land to me?

> 【创15:18】[和合本]当那日，耶和华与亚伯兰立约，说：“我已赐给你的后裔，从埃及河直到幼发拉底大河之地，
> [ESV]On that day the LORD made a covenant with Abram, saying, "To your offspring I give this land, from the river of Egypt to the great river, the river Euphrates,
> 【创15:19】[和合本]就是基尼人、基尼洗人、甲摩尼人、
> [ESV]the land of the Kenites, the Kenizzites, the Kadmonites,
> 【创15:20】[和合本]赫人、比利洗人、利乏音人、
> [ESV]the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Rephaim,
> 【创15:21】[和合本]亚摩利人、迦南人、革迦撒人、耶布斯人之地。”
> [ESV]the Amorites, the Canaanites, the Girgashites and the Jebusites."

Through the establishment the cavernant has promise the way to Abram.

It record 10 tribe. before Israh into the cannan, they are very afraid. I will bring the in the accend. God fulfill everything. It doesnt premise whether Abraham strong frim or with fear.

After that weakness, he sacrie his son Issac. God establish the cavernant not in the premise of loving faithfullness. he premise alone this God become the Abraham's God. Issac's God. 

## Jesus

Issac-Jacob-Isreal-David-anotinted one.

When Jesus came. people has no contribution. Jesus himself walk to Skull. he the cross and drink the cup of bitterness.

Jesus born everything on the cross. that is fulfill what promise to Abraham. is disciple.The curse give to the son of God.

he promise your son will like the star on the sky. to your offspring you will have the river. was hanging on the cross.

sacried on the cross Gentle become the inheritant of the God. the star that he look has me. 

## The promise to me

not only God's work through me. give the Abraham heir. Although there is no land to process. but the fact that give to the land has been fulfill.

We are the accending will be fulfill in the very end. those people that God's hasn't get will be. greater than us right now will be...

all people and all nation will go to the santually of God.

he count this as righteouness. he cannot do anything expect him. God has promise everything. he will acommplish with faith.

it is not us fullfil anything but god hanging on the cross and fulfill everything. he die on the cross. confrim the cavernant of Abram 

 we dont trust ourselves but God faithfulness and Acompish. 

The faithfullness has already accomplish. He gave us all need and all tribe. God has already give us all nation all tribe to us.

The dust of the ground and the starof the sky.when he establish the cavernant he will confirm and acomplish with his people Jesus Christ. we have the faith God count us as righteounees.
