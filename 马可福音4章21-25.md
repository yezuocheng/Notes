# 马可福音4:21-25

> 【可4:21】[和合本]耶稣又对他们说：“人拿灯来，岂是要放在斗底下、床底下，不放在灯台上吗？

## background

how can I understand these three scriptures?

keyword: kingdom of God. John's keyword is Life.

> 【可1:14】[和合本]约翰下监以后，耶稣来到加利利，宣传　神的福音，
> [ESV]Now after John was arrested, Jesus came into Galilee, proclaiming the gospel of God,
> 【可1:15】[和合本]说：“日期满了，　神的国近了！你们当悔改，信福音。”
> [ESV]and saying, "The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand; repent and believe in the gospel."

This sentence is at the beginning of the ministry. no matter Jesus miracle or surment is proclaim the gospel is at hand.

### the kingdom of God is at hand

1. the kingdom of God: the dominient of God. legal government of rebel. From Adam fall, people born as a rebel. dont treat god as god. dont give the thank to god. we use everything. we dont rely on him and not worship him. we glory the false god and be the rebel.

2. when Jesus proclaim the Kingdom of God is at hand: we face the Jesus is facing the Kingdom of God. if we accept the Jesus, we accept the dominion of God. God is ruleing right now. before you are rebel, god dont count it. god give you a opponitunre to repent.  believe the Jesus ,I will be save. if I reject it, I will be treated as a rebellious in hell.
   - [Peach the Gospel: the one we peach they think we are draging him as a religious. they dont think it is about eternal life. What they think is become a religious.] [The preacher has some numbers of people drag someone in the church.]
   - Indoesnia. We can't let him understand I am the servant of kingdom of heaven. And you accept the gospel of God, you will goes to the kingdom of heaven. Or You will be named as a rebel and be in the hell forever.
3. preaching or perform miracle.
   - Speak: gospel. 
   - Do: miracle. Blind eyes open. lamb can walk. Dead man alive. When not happen as the principle of the world. it is out of the world break into the world. the kingdom of God break into the world. with great power.
     - mightly power is a good things? Mightly is destroy power for us.[tiger is not a good things.] [God is almightly, is a good things, fillful all I want that is idol. we will perish in front of God.
     - but Jesus almightly power let him hear, cleanse unclean, make a dead person alive. the mightly power is dangerous. it doesn't mean destory but grace and restruction.
4. Does Jesus succeed?~~Jesus preach by himself will cause impact. that will be thousands of people believe in Christ.~~Not. Jesus ministry as a failier.
   -  Jueh, the ruler and athesis. they reject the dominion of god. becasue comdemn them. only accept the Jesus. but they think they are rightoueous.
   - People? most of the crown believe in Jesus? Not. the miracle raise them ambition. Almightly can recure my discease. Can fillful my will. they can not clam down. their heart is fillful by their desire. can not hear the kingdom of God is near. even want to be the king. the behaviour of Jesus is they force Jesus become a king. they one who shout crucified is them. They have betroy by Jesus, and be concieved by Jesus.
   - 12 disciples? When Jesus decided to die for Jesus. They arguing come to the thrown.  left and right. They dream has ruin. they will be kill when follow Jesus.
   - the reaction when Jesus preach the gospel that the kingdom of God is near. Has the power they comdemn Jesus. the king of God looks so weak. he can only forward back. 

### Great but weak

> 【可1:31】[和合本]耶稣进前拉着她的手，扶她起来，热就退了，她就服侍他们。
> [ESV]And he came and took her by the hand and lifted her up, and the fever left her, and she began to serve them.

Great athouty. can trend the devil. he is the God. 

> 【可3:6】[和合本]法利赛人出去，同希律一党的人商议怎样可以除灭耶稣。
> [ESV]The Pharisees went out and immediately held counsel with the Herodians against him, how to destroy him.
> 【可3:7】[和合本]耶稣和门徒退到海边去，有许多人从加利利跟随他。
> [ESV]Jesus withdrew with his disciples to the sea, and a great crowd followed, from Galilee and Judea

Jesus is withdrew. the one with great power. he cannot try the althourty. when they come, Jesus withdrew. Those who follow him is not the trust worthy. the believe in Jesus. but dont know who Jesus is. 

### Parable

In that situation. the content we read today. Jesus say the parable of sower. the crowd follow him. Jesus use this teaching to remind them. The way to preach is the kingdom of God. very weak. He was rejected. 

Some are the ones along the path,  sown on rocky ground, are the ones sown among thorns. 

but man's percpective is failure but the will of God is hidden and will be fillful. that day, the kingdom of God will show its glory. 30, 60, 100. Their will be kingdom of God.

### V21-25's structors. 

like V26,V30 the kingdom of God is like what what what.

-2parables.

-2 warnings.

## background

 situation. explain the situation. react the circurstance is the kingdom of god break in a great. with a patern of mistery.

- the kingdom of god is glory but hidden. 

  - The kingdom of God come to this earth, what will happen? ~~great power, great almightly. all bad go to hell~~ Jesus rebuke the wind and wave. but the Jesus is a reke and the culpter of the son. He is strepress and prosecute. when he face the prosecution, he is weak and put on the cross.

  - Church. The kingdom of God have to be glory? But Church reveal the kingdom of God so that will be a glory. they want to improve the church of society. but the true church will be counted as bad things. will be procecuted. the phenomenam in the church is very weak.

## v21-22

> 【可4:21】[和合本]耶稣又对他们说：“人拿灯来，岂是要放在斗底下、床底下，不放在灯台上吗？
> [ESV]And he said to them, "Is a lamp brought in to be put under a basket, or under a bed, and not on a stand?

makes us confused it is the man's act. but there is a man in the scripture. The lamp brought into is to be seen not hidden. the kingdom of god come into the world not to hide but be manifest.

> 【可4:22】[和合本]因为掩藏的事，没有不显出来的；隐瞒的事，没有不露出来的。
> [ESV]For nothing is hidden except to be made manifest; nor is anything secret except to come to light.

The greek the meanning is different. 

For nothing is hidden except to be made manifest: 他不是隐秘的，若不是为了要显明。two not sentensten。 If I dont come to worship I will not come. actually I come to worship here. It's hidden now. but be manifest so he are manifest.

the current of tense is now: hidden. but in the f

他也不会成为隐秘的，而是要进入到显明。句子开始有一个也不，甚至不. progressive. has its relationship. no longer be hidden so will be reveal.

now god's kingdom has a feature of hidden. for saken be not hidden. and in the future will be reveal.

### Hidden?

- The kingdom of heaven hid its outward glory for the sake of manifest in the future.

(1)when a man has strong desire gain somethings, makes me blind the things. so that thing which acuupuy my heart must be hide. [we need to hide the toy of childred]

- purpose of kingdom: draw people to face the kingdom of heaven. but people cannot hear the gospel people sworn Jesus for miracle. and Jesus dont have a miracle again. he left he pray at the wilderness. 

> 【可1:35】[和合本]次日早晨，天未亮的时候，耶稣起来，到旷野地方去，在那里祷告。
> [ESV]And rising very early in the morning, while it was still dark, he departed and went out to a desolate place, and there he prayed.
> 【可1:36】[和合本]西门和同伴追了他去，
> [ESV]And Simon and those who were with him searched for him,
> 【可1:37】[和合本]遇见了就对他说：“众人都找你。”
> [ESV]and they found him and said to him, "Everyone is looking for you."
> 【可1:38】[和合本]耶稣对他们说：“我们可以往别处去，到邻近的乡村，我也好在那里传道，因为我是为这事出来的。”
> [ESV]And he said to them, "Let us go on to the next towns, that I may preach there also, for that is why I came out."
> 【可1:39】[和合本]于是在加利利全地，进了会堂，传道赶鬼。
> [ESV]And he went throughout all Galilee, preaching in their synagogues and casting out demons.

That: preach the gospel.

(2)towards sinner the great almightly and the power become bad deeds. 

- Believe in christ at underground church. [many people think the Church have to big let me glory. look at this temple. it has majesty and power.  find that kind of persue will hidden my eyes. God with us is the true church, that is church. when Church  see the church's buliding, try to satisfied by the outside. 100, 10-20 people. come to Isral. big church can not effecture. big church people come and go, not leaving anything. group sharing: always question me.  at big church is mainten the horimany. the pastor give me a great serment. but seldom people hear that. Stop us persuing the big church. we want the outside but the god don't allow.[grace.]
- peter. he become the second biggest at the kindom.

(3)A sinner becomes justicefy. Their become the messager of misaya. but 

> 【路9:54】[和合本]他的门徒雅各、约翰看见了，就说：“主啊，你要我们吩咐火从天上降下来烧灭他们，像以利亚所作的吗（有古卷无“像以利亚所作的”数字）？”
> [ESV]And when his disciples James and John saw it, they said, "Lord, do you want us to tell fire to come down from heaven and consume them?"

> 【路9:55】[和合本]耶稣转身责备两个门徒，说：“你们的心如何，你们并不知道。
> [ESV]But he turned and rebuked them.

we dont know the how deep our evil. but Lord knows.

If the great power is at my hands, is at the church, that will be the bad things. Thank Lord he hidden the glory of God.

### Manifest

it will show as a weak. humuliated. [If the church has the great power, almightly, that is anti-Jesus. if the Jesus show out glory, that is false Jesus.]

> 【太4:8】[和合本]魔鬼又带他上了一座最高的山，将世上的万国与万国的荣华都指给他看，
> [ESV]Again, the devil took him to a very high mountain and showed him all the kingdoms of the world and their glory.
> 【太4:9】[和合本]对他说：“你若俯伏拜我，我就把这一切都赐给你。”
> [ESV]And he said to him, "All these I will give you, if you will fall down and worship me."
> 【太4:10】[和合本]耶稣说：“撒但退去吧（“撒但”就是“抵挡”的意思，乃魔鬼的别名）！因为经上记着说：‘当拜主你的　神，单要侍奉他。’”
> [ESV]Then Jesus said to him, "Be gone, Satan! For it is written, "'You shall worship the Lord your God and him only shall you serve.'"

Mading loser. differciate the theology of glory. theology of cross. the creator of world being killed he is the son of God. Through his weakness, humuniation show its great power.

the reponse of diciple recieve its life through walk with the road of cross.

In the future, the kingdom of God will show directly. Jesus come as almignhtly. The people will renew as greatly. These are great. 

response? how I response?

## V24

> 【可4:24】[和合本]又说：“你们所听的要留心。你们用什么量器量给人，也必用什么量器量给你们，并且要多给你们。
> [ESV]And he said to them, "Pay attention to what you hear: with the measure you use, it will be measured to you, and still more will be added to you.

### the reaction now

you: the kingom of god. in the present hides his glory. The man likely reject the kingdom of heaven. when the kingdom show its glory, that is the time of judgement.

Through the weakness recognise the hidden Kingdom, those people when the kingdom of heaven. they will be accept.

Jesus ragged and hager. he claim himself the king of kingdom of heaven. people shall reconginise him. but people mock him dont  believe in him. they will see the son of man sit at the thron. they will be regard the choise they have made.

### the path of cross

follow Jesus means scrified the lowest the man. he reject. when I face the procecution I will stand at Jesus. but when nomor I stand at right way? I face the situation. other people if dont take the refusge their will be in the hell. Will I willing the use the study time to save him. What do I want the study bring to me? kingdom of heaven but a certain measure I use to the kingdom of heaven other time I use to measure.

### faith

Decision all the time. Scripture is temporary. But it's everlasting what is faith? can make us not cover by the things in our sight. let us truly see the things in the future. take the unseen things as real. The church is the least. but what does church can decide me?

### Can I see?

god gave the kingdom of key to Jesus. but it is hidden. what will I use to measure it? It's the kingdom of kingom call me gain the everlasting life.

where the church needs ministry, where brother and sisters call me. if I rush to serve or become the.

## V23

> 【可4:23】[和合本]有耳可听的，就应当听。”
> [ESV]If anyone has ears to hear, let him hear."
> 【可4:24】[和合本]又说：“你们所听的要留心。你们用什么量器量给人，也必用什么量器量给你们，并且要多给你们。
> [ESV]And he said to them, "Pay attention to what you hear:

### glace.

glace. glace what you hear. glace is a sense of sight. one is hearing, one is require the see. 

glance: eyebow doesn't move. to serious every sepecified not be interact by others.

### reasons:

(1)not easy to understand. so I can understand. [glace. doing the physical questions. give me archievement. Let me understand it  in my brain there is no room.] The mistery of kindom of heaven is hidden. we neet to entry. not achieve by common sense.[the preacher will say a same message. they want the preacher say somethings else. why? help us to glace]

(2) important. if it is not important. why should I solve the problem. 

Bible is important impact the eternal ending. every decision has enternally.

(3)concertrate. 

focus means has dominion on me. only this has dominion. other has no inflence me.

Evi see the tree 

theme of see.

> 【创3:6】[和合本]于是，女人见那棵树的果子好作食物，也悦人的眼目，且是可喜爱的，能使人有智慧，就摘下果子来吃了；又给她丈夫，她丈夫也吃了。
> [ESV]So when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was a delight to the eyes, and that the tree was to be desired to make one wise, she took of its fruit and ate, and she also gave some to her husband who was with her, and he ate.

> 【创6:2】[和合本]　神的儿子们看见人的女子美貌，就随意挑选，娶来为妻。
> [ESV]the sons of God saw that the daughters of man were attractive. And they took as their wives any they chose.

> 【创13:10】[和合本]罗得举目看见约旦河的全平原，直到琐珥，都是滋润的，那地在耶和华未灭所多玛、蛾摩拉以先，如同耶和华的园子，也像埃及地。
> [ESV]And Lot lifted up his eyes and saw that the Jordan Valley was well watered everywhere like the garden of the LORD, like the land of Egypt, in the direction of Zoar. (This was before the LORD destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah.)
> 【创13:12】[和合本]亚伯兰住在迦南地，罗得住在平原的城邑，渐渐挪移帐棚，直到所多玛。
> [ESV]Abram settled in the land of Canaan, while Lot settled among the cities of the valley and moved his tent as far as Sodom.

they all saw somethings. not only the see. but grasp them. dominion on them. they see they glace the things. others things can not go into. they glace in front of them. the everlasting things become blur.

devil: (1)lot alert but one and one goes to Sodom. John the king of the earth. as his hand. prosecrution used by him. we live inside him. (2) lions. Be sober-minded; be watchful. Your adversary the devil prowls around like a roaring lion, seeking someone to devour.

how can be away from devour? glace. 

Let us glace at what should glace at.
