# Matthew6:9-13

## experiecne&knowing

We lack of experience being with Jesus.

- 

- last four:human need.V11-13

- enter the relationship with the prayer.

### why we pray

god will do what is want. but when we pray only what we want. it is comunication to the god. 

ex:borrow the pen from the girl.

god like to bring us into communication. god use all the thing to the relationship. so when we follow the god's taugh, we can 

## hallowed be your name

- no wish. it is the proclaim
  - when I pray. It is the emotion for hallowed be your name.
  - hallowed be your name: the meaning of Yohua goes truth.
  - convanant between yohohua become truth.

ex:exdores. through hit the Falao, let the holy the god's name. through the complete of the god. 

- predict: there will be a action. Everyone will come to god.
- so: A required to god ,emotion become true. please bring the action.

## kingdom come

- two wrong conception.(1)god dominate all the word. Everything is control by god. "Juese said kimdom come, meanning, before Jesus, the kimdom has no come." so the concept is wrong.(2) the age of Jesus. Jual expect raise a king like David, to reign the kingdom of Isral. when Juals saw the miracle of Jesus, the thing the expactation can come true. They regard the god's kingdom is the kingdom on the earth.

- kingdom: exodus 15:18. the lord will reign forever and ever. aross the red sea as a dry. brough the sea together.
  - (1)what has happen in front of us. cross the sea.
  - (2)will: there will be a one thing happen, the Lord will be reign forever. so is not the state. it is the action.
- psalm 47:8-9
  - god reigns over the nations god sits on his holy throne. the princes of the peoples gather as the people of the god of abraham. for the shield of the earth belong to god. he is highly exalted.
  - there will be an action, Lord will be praise.

- conclusion.kingdom:
  - (1)reign of god. 1)gorven by certain rule. 2)a process, not the kingdom of earth.
  - (2)action.there will be a action. from god is not the kingdom as become a kingdom. there will be an action. salvation and punishedment. bring his people enternal life or enternal death.
  - so the old testement a certain future there will be an action. salvation and punished the sin. 
- kingdom is near.
  - mark1:14-15. now after John was 
  - near:~~not happened.~~coming really near. face the kingdom of god immediately.
  - matthew12:28. kingdom of god has come upon you. so the action of Jesus that the kingdom has come.



conclusion:

- kingdom of god is :God directly reign and reign everything.
- will come to the what god like. 
  - but our world has become what god dislike. so when Jesus come. the evil will be jugde. and delight what god like. 
  - finally judgement and salvation.
  - through Jesus come to the earth. ex:苏加诺？ before the 19?? the president proclaim the country become a real country. It different from the Journrist report. because the power. Jesus is not report a thing. but kingdom of Jesus arrive, through the Jesus. so we face the Jesus, we face the enternal of god's reign.
  - so we face Jesus, we are facing the arrival of kingdom come. so we need to whether accept or reject. reject Jesus=reject the kingdom of god. 
  - Man become two kind of people.(1)reject. God's punishment. enternal death.(2)accept.the god protect and bulid him.

- chrsitan is kind of ...But It is the fact. 
  - judge to be death. 
  - but God bring light and hope through Jesus. give a chance: accept or reject. continue to live in death? Jesus is now calling me. nope to Jesus, live in the hell.

## when the Judge enter the world. the Judge will come true.

Jesus frist come. finally Jugde become true.

punishment to Jesus, not on us. through the Judgement and purinshment on Jesus, fullfil the salvation.

the  king of the kingdom of god become the curse of god. and become the death. for me.

we knowing this because the work of holy sprit. when we give the gospel according the bible, there will be the work of holy sprit.

how can the kingdom of god come? through the word and the work of holy spirit.

- reveal and hinden.We can actually experice the work of God. It's the power and life in the church. 
  - But now, the power and life is hinden. the unbeliver can not enter the kingdom of heaven. they will not understand, they can not find the answer.

- cross.
  - glory: the lowest.
  - power :weakness
  - life : death
  - wisdom : foolish.
  - reverse.

- not the final. when the kingdom really come.
  - glory.
  - power
  - life 
  - wisdom 
  - great honor. final salvation. enternal punishment.

## conclusion
