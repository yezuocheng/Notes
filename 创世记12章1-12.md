## The calling Nothing can be seen. 

### (1)great nation

The calling Nothing can be seen. 

1. Abaham has no son. 
   - God sad to Abraham to be a great nation. Husband and wife and Naphew. Abraham has no son.

God promise the great but Abraham. please don't joke. 

### (2)Name

Name has its meaning in the certain place. A symbol of influence in the place we belongs before. All of us apart from the living place come to Jarkata. 

Make the name of human. Doesn't have the name. 

### (3)Bless

> 【创12:2】[和合本]我必叫你成为大国。我必赐福给你，叫你的名为大，你也要叫别人得福。
> [ESV]And I will make of you a great nation, and I will bless you and make your name great, so that you will be a blessing.

> [ESV]I will bless those who bless you, and him who dishonors you I will curse, and in you all the families of the earth shall be blessed."

All be blessed by Abraham cannot be seen.

Abraham goes. and be the sojorner of Canaan. The grantee is the God show up to him. 

## Abraham and his God

### he built there an altar 

As a sorjouner face all kind of hardship in Canaan. recongnise as a grantee is the Lord. but not in the home but atar. A declaim that God is my God. In a very severe hardship he call him name.

### can not be seen

specified the follow to the Lord. The promise is very specific but not fillful in the immediatly way.

> 【罗4:13】[和合本]因为　神应许亚伯拉罕和他后裔必得承受世界，不是因律法，乃是因信而得的义。
> [ESV]For the promise to Abraham and his offspring that he would be heir of the world did not come through the law but through the righteousness of faith.

### God's work

He face the land of Canaan. He cannot rely on his own work. Abraham awkward tried. he refused to called his wife. The only fullfill the promise is God itself.

God set him apart. God is mercy and gratcious. Abraham see the promise by faith.

The promise that the God give to Abraham fulfill by the Jesus Christ. 

## Jesus Christ

### calling

Show perfect obedience: 

wage: Jesus leave his father. he goes to where God's will. (Not to the Palace. he brought to Eygi. A poor carpenter son.)Jarkata is more like the place to go. From the eternalty God's father he come to earth as a man.

Go from your country and your kindred and your father's house to the crowd of sinner. 

### Great nation

The nation promise to the Abraham. not includes the Jews. even the Gentiles.

> 【诗2:2】[和合本]世上的君王一齐起来，臣宰一同商议，要敌挡耶和华并他的受膏者，
> [ESV]The kings of the earth set themselves, and the rulers take counsel together, against the LORD and against his Anointed, saying,
> 【诗2:7】[和合本]受膏者说：“我要传圣旨。耶和华曾对我说：‘你是我的儿子，我今日生你。
> [ESV]I will tell of the decree: The LORD said to me, "You are my Son; today I have begotten you.

> 【诗2:7】[和合本]受膏者说：“我要传圣旨。耶和华曾对我说：‘你是我的儿子，我今日生你。
> [ESV]I will tell of the decree: The LORD said to me, "You are my Son; today I have begotten you.
> 【诗2:8】[和合本]你求我，我就将列国赐你为基业，将地极赐你为田产。
> [ESV]Ask of me, and I will make the nations your heritage, and the ends of the earth your possession.

The kingdom of our Lord is the great naiton.

### Name

no greater name than Jesus.

Every name burst in the dust. [First Emperor's name was cut off in the second gerneration.]

History is his story. The history is the story he enter the history.

### Bless

I will bless those who bless you, and him who dishonors you I will curse, and in you all the families of the earth shall be blessed."

It show the bless is how we deal with the cross. A right hand Jesus's cross goes to Jesus heaven. The left Jesus cross goes to the hell.

conclusion: Final salvation has arrived. Follow God his faith fulfill by the son of God Jesus Christ.

(1)come to our history.(2)brought the great kindom into earth.(3)brought the final comdemnation to earth)(3)react the kingdom.

Even the don't know where to goes. you must leave your father house. in the kingdom I show you.

## Disciple

### Calling

> 【太4:19】[和合本]耶稣对他们说：“来跟从我！我要叫你们得人如得鱼一样。”
> [ESV]And he said to them, "Follow me, and I will make you fishers of men."

### Every Jesus experience become thier reality[great nation &name]

around the Jerusem like the spy to the Canaan. They preach the Gospel. They were put in the Jail. They footstep in the Asia, Affica. testimony before kingdom. A man hanging on the cross. death be headed. they went out and the father house. under the guildence of Jesus Christ. They alive in the live of world don't worth. 

They see the kindom by they own eyes. The see the heaven, preach the gosple and estabilised the church. manifest the Jesus name. 

### bless 

Act of Jesus to the earth, and the Act through the world. All the nation be blessed by the Jesus. Even us.

## Facing the same calling

1. same & even clearly.
   - we are not where to go. we are here.
2. think: What kind of darkness we are facing.
   - idols. we don't truely know the God. but not worship him. 
   - never face the calling. [we were under the curse and judgement of God.]
   - Mainland China. Curse by God.
3. examine ourselves: we follow Jesus sometime we fall. It's the unbeliever that make us fall. man walk by the cross. man's fall by our sin. What give our hardship is our sin. The hardship is sin.  God provide grace that makes through the sins. what makes us fall is ours sin.
4. True obendience of Jesus Christ. Facing the promise be given by the Cross. The love of Cross is so real. we leave by a decision. After a dicision, still to face the decision we face before. the foundation is not my country and my father.
5. True face the salvation is the very foundation of my life or just repeat to gose to the south nation.
   - sojourner. This is not my home.

> 【来11:16】[和合本]他们却羡慕一个更美的家乡，就是在天上的。所以　神被称为他们的　神，并不以为耻，因为他已经给他们预备了一座城。
> [ESV]But as it is, they desire a better country, that is, a heavenly one. Therefore God is not ashamed to be called their God, for he has prepared for them a city.

### call upon God's name

pray. The harship will be the cause to pray to the God. [testimony of pinoor administery] 

Facing the hardship. GO to pray the God. 

pray for the city of salon. Not for his Naphew. it is because not to destroy the cities. we can pray the Salon. pray for Jarkata. Pray for Beijing. We will be conforded

### Bless

Curse us be cursed. in the relationship of union. find myself in God's protection. thinking how bad.

God's protection is in the that kinds of hardship. it is the testimony of Gospel. when we come to here as a minisionary. The innersaction of Gospel.

Leave the country leave the kingdom of house. we are facing the calling in our life. thinking how can be the bless towards nation. God's calling the Abraham is towards me. that is calling me. He calling to promise be with us and protect us. bless us.
