## Structure

## Sin and death

Outer layer is about 

- This is the problem we face. We may face the sickness. This is the about us.

- The bilbe tell the answer. Most of us don't know why we need Jesus. 

- Maybe be happy. Jesus come not for that. THe bible tell us about sin and death. Some people may say i'll be young forever.

- A man 80 guy with 80 years old guys need believe in jesus. but is the illusion.
  - We dont believe that a young is so ugent to believe in jesus. But it's quiet busy.
  - A boy come to church. But he leave. For him, he thought that he have the time to believe in jesus. For us we think we still have time to peach to him. If the decision of the Jesus is his last decision. He have no salvation. He have to face the anger of God by himself.
  - We have to face the Jesus. It's cruical to us.

## people find jesus

> 【路8:40】[和合本]耶稣回来的时候，众人迎接他，因为他们都等候他。
> [KJV]And it came to pass, that, when Jesus was returned, the people gladly received him: for they were all waiting for him.

A lot of people waiting for Jesus. 

- People reaction to Jesus:
  - Follow Jesus ugeny.(1)They want to create a kindom. Jesus do not give himself to them.(2)for 
  - trusting in jesus christ alone, and follow jesus for enternally life.
- Jesus know the people's expactation. Jesus know if they want the gift of today, they will be hell forever.

## Jairus

> 【路8:41】[和合本]有一个管会堂的，名叫睚鲁，来俯伏在耶稣脚前，求耶稣到他家里去。
> [KJV]And, behold, there came a man named Jairus, and he was a ruler of the synagogue: and he fell down at Jesus' feet, and besought him that he would come into his house:
>
> 【路8:42】[和合本]因他有一个独生女儿，约有十二岁，快要死了。耶稣去的时候，众人拥挤他。
> [KJV]For he had one only daughter, about twelve years of age, and she lay a dying. But as he went the people thronged him.

- Jesus will not help him. But jesus has mercy.

- and he fell down at Jesus' feet: not because his humble. Little daughter she is quiet precious to her father. 
-  twelve years of age: the father witness the daughter growth. 
- No matter what the father done, the father can't not save his daughter.
- Jairus have the religious right, social status, his presue to die for his daughter can't save his daughter.
- We have the time,  one day the people we love are dying. But no matter we do, we can't save the daughter. Even I sacrified myself I cant save the daugher. 

## A woman

> 【路8:43】[和合本]有一个女人，患了十二年的血漏，在医生手里花尽了她一切养生的，并没有一人能医好她。
> [KJV]And a woman having an issue of blood twelve years, which had spent all her living upon physicians, neither could be healed of any,

- issue of blood: no a physical desess. but the god 

> 【利15:25】[和合本]“女人若在经期以外患多日的血漏；或是经期过长，有了漏症，她就因这漏症不洁净，与她在经期不洁净一样。
> [KJV]And if a woman have an issue of her blood many days out of the time of her separation, or if it run beyond the time of her separation; all the days of the issue of her uncleanness shall be as the days of her separation: she shall be unclean.
> 【利15:26】[和合本]她在患漏症的日子所躺的床、所坐的物都要看为不洁净，与她月经的时候一样。
> [KJV]Every bed whereon she lieth all the days of her issue shall be unto her as the bed of her separation: and whatsoever she sitteth upon shall be unclean, as the uncleanness of her separation.
> 【利15:27】[和合本]凡摸这些物件的，就为不洁净，必不洁净到晚上，并要洗衣服，用水洗澡。
> [KJV]And whosoever toucheth those things shall be unclean, and shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the even.
> 【利15:28】[和合本]女人的漏症若好了，就要计算七天，然后才为洁净。
> [KJV]But if she be cleansed of her issue, then she shall number to herself seven days, and after that she shall be clean.
> 【利15:29】[和合本]第八天，要取两只斑鸠或是两只雏鸽，带到会幕门口给祭司。
> [KJV]And on the eighth day she shall take unto her two turtles, or two young pigeons, and bring them unto the priest, to the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.
> 【利15:30】[和合本]祭司要献一只为赎罪祭，一只为燔祭；因那人血漏不洁，祭司要在耶和华面前为她赎罪。
> [KJV]And the priest shall offer the one for a sin offering, and the other for a burnt offering; and the priest shall make an atonement for her before the LORD for the issue of her uncleanness.

- issue of blood: God remember one sin. The god show outside. In term of the issue of blood, she will be separate. She will be treated as unclean.
- She afraid us, have many 12 years a woman have. There is one thought in her mind, do everything to heal the sickness.
- It doesn't have the faith to be healed. Or the want to be heal. But she can't do anything about her sickness.

> 【路8:44】[和合本]她来到耶稣背后，摸他的衣裳䍁子，血漏立刻就止住了。
> [KJV]Came behind him, and touched the border of his garment: and immediately her issue of blood stanched.
> 【路8:45】[和合本]耶稣说：“摸我的是谁？”众人都不承认。彼得和同行的人都说：“夫子，众人拥拥挤挤紧靠着你。（有古卷在此有“你还问摸我的是谁吗？”）”
> [KJV]And Jesus said, Who touched me? When all denied, Peter and they that were with him said, Master, the multitude throng thee and press thee, and sayest thou, Who touched me?

- She walk to the stree, walk into the crown. But just want to touched the border of his garment.
- It's dangerous, no matter who know the woman will hit her.
- Not the faith of the woman save the woman.
  - woman have the faith to docter, to other man. But the faith cannot save the woman.
  - Only faith to the right object can bring miracle. The object of faith is Jesus, so when the woman touch the Jesus, Because the power and the just puring to the woman. She caught rehelled.
- She want to walk away.

> [KJV]And Jesus said, Who touched me? When all denied, 

> 【路8:45】[和合本]耶稣说：“摸我的是谁？”众人都不承认。彼得和同行的人都说：“夫子，众人拥拥挤挤紧靠着你。（有古卷在此有“你还问摸我的是谁吗？”）”
> [KJV]And Jesus said, Who touched me? When all denied, Peter and they that were with him said, Master, the multitude throng thee and press thee, and sayest thou, Who touched me?

the crowl, but who touch me.

This not the power change. It is the mercy that jesus christ into the jesus.

> 【路8:47】[和合本]那女人知道不能隐藏，就战战兢兢地来俯伏在耶稣脚前，把摸他的缘故和怎样立刻得好了，当着众人都说出来。
> [KJV]And when the woman saw that she was not hid, she came trembling, and falling down before him, she declared unto him before all the people for what cause she had touched him, and how she was healed immediately.

And when the woman saw that she was not hid, she came trembling: two problem.

1. She think the heal is the super power. She have the super power by touch. She think the clothes that a person have will have the power. 
2. She dont want to give herself to jesus, or have relationship to jesus. no matter how jesus heal him.
   - if she just got heal, and run away, she'll think how she got heal is about touching. she will live with the faith  by touching. She will be caught by other serious problem, she'll be sent to hell forever.
   - jesus know the woman do not really know the woman. 

> 【路8:48】[和合本]耶稣对她说：“女儿，你的信救了你，平平安安地去吧！”
> [KJV]And he said unto her, Daughter, be of good comfort: thy faith hath made thee whole; go in peace.

- thy faith hath made thee whole; go in peace.: She come into relationship with the jesus, because her 

- beliveing in christ, give himself to jesus, as the lord as salvior, and follow jesus.
  - so the woman got heal, and the her sin that rest on her. how jesus clean to her and united to her.

## Jairus's daugher

> 【路8:49】[和合本]还说话的时候，有人从管会堂的家里来，说：“你的女儿死了，不要劳动夫子。”
> [KJV]While he yet spake, there cometh one from the ruler of the synagogue's house, saying to him, Thy daughter is dead; trouble not the Master.
> 【路8:50】[和合本]耶稣听见就对他说：“不要怕，只要信，你的女儿就必得救！”
> [KJV]But when Jesus heard it, he answered him, saying, Fear not: believe only, and she shall be made whole.

- When Jairus come to jesus,  facing two reality: (1) the word of people saying to him, Thy daughter is dead(2)the present of jesus.
- [KJV]But when Jesus heard it, he answered him, saying, Fear not: believe only, and she shall be made whole.

> 【路8:51】[和合本]耶稣到了他的家，除了彼得、约翰、雅各和女儿的父母，不许别人同他进去。
> [KJV]And when he came into the house, he suffered no man to go in, save Peter, and James, and John, and the father and the mother of the maiden.
> 【路8:52】[和合本]众人都为这女儿哀哭捶胸。耶稣说：“不要哭，她不是死了，是睡着了。”
> [KJV]And all wept, and bewailed her: but he said, Weep not; she is not dead, but sleepeth.

- people are crying. and all wept, and bewailed her. there is no way to change the result of the daughter.

- They will crying, but the daughter cannot hear.

> 【路8:53】[和合本]他们晓得女儿已经死了，就嗤笑耶稣。
> [KJV]And they laughed him to scorn, knowing that she was dead.

the crowl began to laugh. because they knowing the 

two realatlity:(1) what we seen (2) What jesus said.

> 【路8:54】[和合本]耶稣拉着她的手，呼叫说：“女儿，起来吧！”
> [KJV]And he put them all out, and took her by the hand, and called, saying, Maid, arise.

They have done before, daugher arise! but child dead.

But when jesus called her daugher, maid arise.

The jesus not make the fake dying people come to life but is turely dead. 

> 【路8:55】[和合本]她的灵魂便回来，她就立刻起来了。耶稣吩咐给她东西吃。
> [KJV]And her spirit came again, and she arose straightway: and he commanded to give her meat.
> 【路8:56】[和合本]她的父母惊奇得很。耶稣嘱咐他们，不要把所作的事告诉人。
> [KJV]And her parents were astonished: but he charged them that they should tell no man what was done.

 he charged them that they should tell no man what was done: jesus 

jesus have done is a sign. Showing Jesus is the misaya.

## Conclusion

- Outside layer is a dead child come to life. Jesus give us life.
  - life.

- Inside part is how jesus clean the sin. 
  - Sin and the clean of the sin.
- Put the thing togher. people are dying because our sin.
  - For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.
  - I'll die forever, i'll be in hell forever. we are actually have sin.
- I commit the sin. The judge will come. Someone may said I may have the daughter are dying nor I have a sickness that can't be healed. but we may face the problem we can't heal the sick. we will feel despair.
- Someday We loved or we are dying.
- we come to live and Like we walk around and die.

> 【来9:27】[和合本]按着定命，人人都有一死，死后且有审判。
> [KJV]And as it is appointed unto men once to die, but after this the judgment:

I‘ll face the judge of the god. Or i have everlasting life or i will go to hell forever.

- severe sickness. but one sickness is more sickness : sin. But we have the answer: come to jesus. Because God save the people  by jesus. Her sin was clean by jesus. 

> 【太20:28】[和合本]正如人子来，不是要受人的服侍，乃是要服侍人，并且要舍命，作多人的赎价。”
> [KJV]Even as the Son of man came not to be ministered unto, but to minister, and to give his life a ransom for many.

> 【罗6:23】[和合本]因为罪的工价乃是死；惟有　神的恩赐，在我们的主基督耶稣里，乃是永生。
> [KJV]For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.

Now jesus come and suffer , and into the judgement just want to save us.
