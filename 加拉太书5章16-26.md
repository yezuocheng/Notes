基督徒是什么呢？不仅仅是外在的人与人的区别。

## Christan

- christan has two life in it.(1) those are believer has flesh life. (2)spritral life.
  - For the desires of the flesh are against the Spirit, and the desires of the Spirit are against the flesh. sometime lost in flesh life. sometime lost in spririt life.

- the verse is about christan life. the point is to walk by the spirit.

- Holy spirit. one of the person of trintiy God. Do you believe God itself in you?
- Flesh and Spirit. Spirit is bigger. the more things we experience is life. the moon is big and star are small. Flesh is bigger because flesh is closer to us.
  - follow spirit:Fight with flesh. do the things that the flesh doesn't like? the path of christan. experience hard. it's the path that Jesus face.[christ say a word everyone want to kill him. Jesus cast out demon, but people say he cast out by demon. the way the world do to the gospel. you will suffer by the flesh.] walk in the spirit.
  - love somebody, I want to let him to have eternal life, but he hate me. the characterist of spirirt face the hardship of flesh.
- when I walk by the spirit, world hate me. If I follow flesh, God doesn't like me.

## Follow spirit

- we don't understand the spirit alone. we proclaim by the spirit in church. he spirit of christ show the way of God. and reveal the word of God.

- Christ is the manifest by the spirit and promclaim by the church. one of it is define by other three.
  - we reject the spirit without the word. we experience the spirit of God. scribeture give testimony of the spirit.
  - spirit not be reveal by itself, not a feeling. it's very dangerous.

- we establish ourself in the bible. spirit wont give the testimony of itself or father.

## sexual immorality, impurity, sensuality,

- sexual immorality=impurity=sensuality,

- impurity: mindful of thought, no boundary relationship.
- sexual immorality, impurity, sensuality, are the same accent of sex sin.
  - the 

## idolatry, sorcery, enmity

idolatry: worship budda. but the force has a dominary is my idol. Money, love, health.

love: man is a man before God. marriage is before God. cleanse married is blessed from God.

money: be cursed by God.

## jealousy, fits of anger, rivalries, dissensions, divisions,

confinct of the desire.

rivalries: the love in the flesh called rivalries. we need to be sobber-mindded. why there is no love in church? that is called rivalries.

rivalries: fall in the group. the relationship not in the gospel is call the rivalries. when the davire the relationship will hurt the church.

the make a coesive the group is the benefit. rivalries becomes dissensions. we are trying to make a relationship of saint communion of saints. [ two people talk about the words. if the colession of the word is facing the coleesion of God]一次灵里的相同相交会使爱情婚姻升华。communian. purify the connection of the God. become the inside and relation of the God.

 When I close to somebody, if it is flesh. we will face the dissensions and offensive to God. we persue the truth and be moved by God. That relationship is pleased by God.

## How to we know is the true faith or not?

bible. bible reveal christ. the turely rise from the death. he come to save us, redeem us. he is true God. only he ressurection from death. he live eternaly. he control everything. why christany is the true relious. he proclaim he is Jesus, he ressurctive from the death.

## envy, drunkenness, orgies, 

consiquence of sin. ragioucal the flesh.

## cannot escape from hell

> I warn you, as I warned you before, that those who do such things will not inherit the kingdom of God.

why we sit here today? we face the eternal life or hell. how long of the life is like 80 years. how I live after I die? I spend my life in hell or heaven? they will not in heaven. bear the consiquence in hell. my wealth my education cannot let me escape from hell. that is the purpose of come to church. 

## But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, self-control;

### love

no condition love a soul. for the benefit of God pay the endless price.爱：为了对方的益处成全对方，爱一个人。pay the price for him and fillful him.为了对方永恒的益处成全对方。使对方for the sake of etenalty I can pay whatever we .who can? jesus.only jesus is love. only Jesus can fullfil the benefit of its people.  I believe in Christ and have the life of christ. I guide by the . when I can love the person who I don't like I start to grow.

### Joy

best school you joy. where is the joy from christ? through harship I have joy. 

when I experience of failure of  life why I joy? I have the hope of resurrection. even I in the harship I have etelnal hope. I experience the spirituall joy. I walk with Jesus I experienec the joy. [the policeman preach the gospel evil treat. how jesus look at me? does Jesus please what I do? A year after will be bless by the christ. you will definally experience the joy of christ. when I though about this.]

I do something joy of God, I experience the joy from God.

### peace

not in a hostle relationship.

when a man experience the peace from God. I am in the peace relationship with God.

when I in the gospel, when I face the one who harm me. I enter the harmony relationship. I can torant. I have the peace. The peace from gospel, I have the relationship of brother and sister.

### patience-Goal

christ have the patient when I sin agaist him. 

through Christ he has his own plan. we have patience becuase I have a frim goal.

benefit of church. benefit of  a soul.

I deny myself. decide by purpose. our goal of life will change. I have a new goal. the goal is to save those the christ want to save. I have patience toward my enermy.[ every week takes 4 hours a week. you spend 6 weeks. I do the unreasonly things. the one I don't believe break through your principle. But have already break the principle.] patience his dont believe. not I. God guiding him.

一个成熟的人目标和教会目标一样，他就顺服、忍耐弟兄姐妹、忍耐自己的处境的艰难，因为他里面有超越的目标，上帝给我超越的力量。忍耐是被目标决定的。目标决定了我们的目标过程策略。我是一个万米运动员跌倒了还跑。

surpass the goal. even doesn't matter. my God is the goal. I don't pleased by the people. I was a donminated.

###  kindness, goodness

christan in the street. make my heart not so numb. christ heal the lambersicy. mercy. experience what he experience. suffer he suffer. when Jesus face a desprate.

### faithfulness

I have a purpose I keep the covanant. fulfill my goal toward him. I have a stardard. try not to be late. serve a person I keep the convant. because I have a goal, so I keep convanant.

God have a covanant toward me. I will experience the God itself.[next Tuesday 2pm. pray for him. 2.30pm doesn't come. My God keep covanant towards me. My God never shame me. ]Become faith is 

### gentleness

not to be easily provoke. I face the ending I dont have gentleness. Gain a person soul can be kindly person. the one who competitive he die. I preach toward the stranger soul this is my God love the soul so much. I have absolute gentle toward him. he is so gentle. through saviour. I will meet the gentleness God.

### control

selfcontrol.  live longer? Can't endage my thought. dominated the goal. my control can be fulifill.

9 fruit is chrsit himself. If I have the charactistive It the time I experience Jesus. it's not the coruption of me. The life of christ is the manifest the Jesus. 

christ guide me through the spirit. In the spirit I will not obey the law. I have nothing do with the law. law is for Christ. those 

我与基督同钉十字架=我在罪中死了=我不在律法之下=基督钉十字架的时候，我怎么与他一同钉十字架=与基督同死=死的是肉体和肉体的邪情私欲。肉体被肉体的邪情私欲支配。圣灵是圣灵的强大的神本身，圣灵藉着福音之爱感动我带领我，就使我不做神不喜悦的事情，我的生命的特征表现为不体贴肉体，不犯罪，我不体贴肉体的生命叫做我在肉体死了，我与基督同钉十字架了，如今活着不再是我，是基督在我里面活着，耶稣2000年前死的，怎么拯救今天的我？把圣灵赐给我，藉着圣灵，藉着教会宣讲的道进入与基督的联合，在于基督的而联合的中我与基督同死，与基督同活。我靠着圣灵我得着了生命。靠着圣灵生命成长更新。

## conceited

[ESV]Let us not become conceited, provoking one another, envying one another.

conceited:you circumcised that they may boast in your flesh. true circumcised is the holy reborn.

live under the law: provoking one another, envying one another. bite our, envaish other

live by the spirit not live by the certain feeling. 我们面对福音，付代价，就是顺从圣灵。真正耶稣在我里面，基督在我里面。

## I dont have the feeling in Jesus love.

when I enter the suffering I can experience the love of God. persicutive I can feel the God's love.

battlefried I experience Jesus. Paul in the filipie he experience Jesus. You are in the filipie of jail. Jesus you are present here in filipie. the love of God shoke the Paul. I will experience the Great love of Jesus.
