> 1And when he returned to Capernaum after some days, it was reported that he was at home. 2And many were gathered together, so that there was no more room, not even at the door. And he was preaching the word to them. 3And they came, bringing to him a paralytic carried by four men. 4And when they could not get near him because of the crowd, they removed the roof above him, and when they had made an opening, they let down the bed on which the paralytic lay. 5And when Jesus saw their faith, he said to the paralytic, ‚ÄúSon, your sins are forgiven.‚Äù 6Now some of the scribes were sitting there, questioning in their hearts, 7‚ÄúWhy does this man speak like that? He is blaspheming! Who can forgive sins but God alone?‚Äù 8And immediately Jesus, perceiving in his spirit that they thus questioned within themselves, said to them, ‚ÄúWhy do you question these things in your hearts? 9Which is easier, to say to the paralytic, ‚ÄòYour sins are forgiven,‚Äô or to say, ‚ÄòRise, take up your bed and walk‚Äô?10But that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins‚Äù‚Äîhe said to the paralytic‚Äî 11‚ÄúI say to you, rise, pick up your bed, and go home.‚Äù 12And he rose and immediately picked up his bed and went out before them all, so that they were all amazed and glorified God, saying, ‚ÄúWe never saw anything like this!‚Äù

- 1And when he returned to Capernaum after some days, it was reported that he was at home. 
  - return: Jesus ministry start at Capernaum. Cast out unclean sprint. Heal Simon Peter's mother heat. Jesus cast out demons and heal the crowd.
- Crowd: 38And he said to them, ‚ÄúLet us go on to the next towns, that I may preach there also, for that is why I came out.‚Äù
  - why Jesus left the crowl. People have wrong expantation about Jesus, Jesus left.
  - Jesus didn't left them behind forever.

## paralytic

- Carried by four man.
- Can not come to Jesus, so they remove the roof. they led down the pralytic's bed.

- paralytic: disable person.
  - Girl. he will also fall in love to a girl. But cannot go to the girl. Feeling and action are different. bully. He cannot fight back.
  - His decision and action can not meet together.

- Faith:

  - The faith belongs to the four guy.
- 2 things in christan life :(1)got to see Jesus,(2)bring people to Jesus.
  - before Jesus: Being comdemn. after Jesus: wash away my sin.
  - Take other to Jesus. Other unbeliever cannot go to Jesus by ourselves.

##  ‚ÄúSon, your sins are forgiven.‚Äù

- Shock, weird. Are you kidding me? This is not the time saying the sin are forgiven.
  - We have our own expectation to go to Church. No of the peolple is taking about what I am caring.  I just heard is about bible.
  - Why I am caring is different from god.  Try to listen what the god is caring.

## Sin and sickness

- Sinüëâdeath. IF sin partically control me, it become sick. Sin and death is  related. Also sin and sick is relative.

- Maybe I focus on the sick. I need to what bible focus.
- Sin is against god.
  - Most important problem is we have sin.

## scribes

- quite know about old testement. copy the old testement.
- 6Now some of the scribes were sitting there, questioning in their hearts, 7‚ÄúWhy does this man speak like that? He is blaspheming! Who can forgive sins but God alone?‚Äù 8And immediately Jesus, perceiving in his spirit that they thus questioned within themselves, said to them, ‚ÄúWhy do you question these things in your hearts
- Blasphemming: 
  - Only god have authority: only god can forgive sins.
  - Jesus saying a thing like this, is Jsesusu is god?
  - Only god can forgive things, and Jesus is god,. They didn't think so.
- Question inside the heart.

## saying&authority

> ‚ÄúWhy do you question these things in your hearts?

Should be scare. Âè™ÊúâËÄ∂Á®£ËÉΩÂ§üÊü•È™å‰∫∫ÂøÉ„ÄÇ

> 9Which is easier, to say to the paralytic, ‚ÄòYour sins are forgiven,‚Äô or to say, ‚ÄòRise, take up your bed and walk‚Äô?

- If Just saying: "Your sins are forgiven" is easier than let the paralytic to walk.

- authority: demon and survant can healing. but forgiveness of sin can only be done by god.

- Son of man:
  - Not the way how he introduce himself.
  - Uncommon. 13‚ÄúI saw in the night visions, and behold, with the clouds of heaven .there came one like a son of man, and he came to the Ancient of Days and was presented before him. 14 And to him was given dominion and glory and a kingdom, that all peoples, nations, and languages should serve him; his dominion is an everlasting dominion, which shall not pass away, and his kingdom one that shall not be destroyed.
  - I:  consequence he face, his mission.
  - son of man: Misaya, christ.

- Misaya have the authority to forgive the sin.

## Paralytic

- used to long to be healed, find nothing.
- paralytic can not move.
- hear the voice:11‚ÄúI say to you, rise, pick up your bed, and go home.‚Äù 
- Will I try to stand up because Jesus say this? paralytic raise and walk.
- lift by four man‚Üíwent through the crowd.

- glorified god: realize the god is right here.

- 10,000 times to rise but he cannot, he try hard is only his wish.
- but no one order to the paralytic.
- Jesus say to paralytic :"raise and pick up your bed and go home." Jesus is god himself.
- Jesus forgive his sin and tell him walk.

## To me

- I am sprit paralytic, and moral paralytic. I know which is right or wrong. I know which is right or wrong, but I can't. I want to leave my sin and walk but I can't.
- I need the one. Son of god Jesus. When he turly is here, and saying my sin are forgive.
- He die and replace me. my sin. suffer All I deserve.
- The block of the bless from the god. Through the Jesus all coming to me, because All my sin are forgiven.
- I am someone new. making the different. In Christ I have all the freedom to choose. Listen or not listen? If I listen I can walk.
- Every moring I am new. Inside I renew. Even moring and afternoon I am different. Every time he say to me, son your sin are forgiven. 
- Jesus I got the freedom, all the chains are gone. 
- Jesus came for this. He is waiting the paralytic. I was brought here today, he has someting do with you.
- 5:17
- moses in the 80. 40 grow up at palace. 40 years in the wilderness with the sheep. 80 able to see god. Moses want to reject the god. the reason is I have a slow togue. God say to Moses I create the mouth. God say to Moses Erren be the mouth, he didn't say much. God decide everything. Now he through Jesus make me new. Maybe I will fail, when I hear the voice, and I am freedom. When I put my trap again. If I hear the voice that forgive me. I can immediately leave the sin.
- Listen to Jesus and go out the sin. The one who hear Jesus is quite different. We hear the word of Jesus. We are in Jesus.
