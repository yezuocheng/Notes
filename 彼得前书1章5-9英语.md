# 彼得前书1章5-9英语

1Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ,To those who are elect exiles of the Dispersion in Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia, 2according to the foreknowledge of God the Father, in the sanctification of the Spirit, for obedience to Jesus Christ and for sprinkling with his blood:May grace and peace be multiplied to you.

Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ! According to his great mercy, he has caused us to be born again to a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead, 4to an inheritance that is imperishable, undefiled, and unfading, kept in heaven for you, 

5who by God’s power are being guarded through faith for a salvation ready to be revealed in the last time. 6In this you rejoice, though now for a little while, if necessary, you have been grieved by various trials, 7so that the tested genuineness of your faith—more precious than gold that perishes though it is tested by fire—may be found to result in praise and glory and honor at the revelation of Jesus Christ. 8Though you have not seen him, you love him. Though you do not now see him, you believe in him and rejoice with joy that is inexpressible and filled with glory, 9obtaining the outcome of your faith, the salvation of your souls.

> 【彼前1:1】耶稣基督的使徒彼得写信给那分散在本都、加拉太、加帕多家、亚细亚、庇推尼寄居的，
> 【彼前1:2】就是照父　神的先见被拣选，藉着圣灵得成圣洁，以致顺服耶稣基督，又蒙他血所洒的人。愿恩惠、平安多多地加给你们！
> 【彼前1:3】愿颂赞归于我们主耶稣基督的父　神，他曾照自己的大怜悯，藉耶稣基督从死里复活，重生了我们，叫我们有活泼的盼望，
> 【彼前1:4】可以得着不能朽坏、不能玷污、不能衰残、为你们存留在天上的基业。
> 【彼前1:5】你们这因信蒙　神能力保守的人，必能得着所预备、到末世要显现的救恩。
> 【彼前1:6】因此，你们是大有喜乐。但如今在百般的试炼中暂时忧愁，
> 【彼前1:7】叫你们的信心既被试验，就比那被火试验仍然能坏的金子更显宝贵，可以在耶稣基督显现的时候，得着称赞、荣耀、尊贵。
> 【彼前1:8】你们虽然没有见过他，却是爱他。如今虽不得看见，却因信他就有说不出来、满有荣光的大喜乐，
> 【彼前1:9】并且得着你们信心的果效，就是灵魂的救恩。
